# SpaceX - Fetch API

In this program, I practiced using fetch using the [SpaceX API].
(https://docs.spacexdata.com/#5fc4c846-c373-43df-a10a-e9faf80a8b0a).
From the very beginning, a page appears in which the sorting goes by flight id.
When you click on the mission name, you can change the sorting to alphabetical, first A-Z (down arrow), or Z-A (up arrow).
Also, you can navigate through the results by pressing the back or forward buttons.
