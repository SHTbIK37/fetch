In this program, I practiced using fetch using the SpaceX API.
From the very beginning, a page appears in which the sorting goes by flight id.
When you click on the mission name, you can change the sorting to alphabetical, first A-Z (down arrow), or Z-A (up arrow).
Also scroll through the pages with the results by pressing the back buttons and forward.
